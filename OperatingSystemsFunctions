The filing system in Windows operating systems is un-matched. It is by far ahead of all other OS's; that is why you see almost all business's using Windows. Microsoft makes it so easy to copy, rename, move, etc. documents. 
The sleek, easy to navigate style of iOS is why I chose to be team Apple. You can easily move and group applications making it perfect for whatever layout you would like. The fast processing speeds are a great feature as well. That combined with all the ways to personalize to your liking, why wouldn't you choose Apple?
Windows does a great job of creating a layout that anybody can easily use. Whether you're at work or you use a computer at the library, it most likely has Windows and pretty much anyone can sit down and instantly know how to navigate to use the computer how they please.
